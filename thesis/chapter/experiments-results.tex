    \chapter{Experiments and Results}\label{ch:experiments-and-results}
    In this section we present the results of all the experiments performed. We will also discuss any problems that arose during the conduct of these experiments and provide further information on how we selected certain methods and hyperparameters for more extensive testing.

    By performing a series of experiments, we show how our agent performs in a given environment. We compare the best and worst performing models and discuss the results of our experiments with the baseline models and benchmarks in~\cref{sec:experiments}. We also discuss and compare the hyperparameter settings and the advantages and disadvantages of all the datasets used in~\cref{subsec:hyperparameters}. We also provide some information on how we approached performance testing of the proposed models and what technologies were used for the MLOps concepts, such as tracking training and test runs~\cref{sec:wandb}. Finally, we discuss the results of our experiments and provide a summary of our findings~\cref{sec:summary}.

    \section{Focus of the experiments}\label{sec:focus-of-the-experiments}
    In~\cref{ch:stock-portfolio-allocation}, we implement the \emph{Stock Portfolio Allocation Environment}, while in the this chapter, we conduct experiments to \emph{evaluate} the trained models. Our aim is to determine the best \emph{parameters} and \emph{datasets} for training and testing. To achieve this, we use a \emph{sweeping} approach to test the hyperparameters for each algorithm and dataset. We evaluate each configuration of hyperparameters in terms of the model's performance, which is measured by the total reward calculated as the cumulative product of the portfolio value.

    We compare the best and worst performing models with other models and common indexes as baselines. Our results indicate that appropriate hyperparameters and datasets can train the agent sufficiently well to outperform common indexes and other publicly available models for Portfolio Allocation (using Reinforcement Learning). This makes them valuable tools for portfolio allocation in financial markets.

    Thus, the main goal of this chapter is to evaluate the trained models' performance through rigorous experimentation and identify the best \emph{parameters} and \emph{datasets} for optimal performance. We also test the model's \emph{robustness} by assessing its stability using the best hyperparameters for the datasets and the specific algorithm used to train the model. This helps us ensure that the model is reliable and can perform consistently well under different conditions. The robustness test helps us identify potential weaknesses or limitations that may need to be addressed.

    \subsection{Reproducing Results}
    Furthermore, not only do we provide the results of our work in this thesis, but we also make all datasets and training runs with a history of hyperparameters for each algorithm publicly available on the W\&B website. \textbf{By visiting the following URL: \url{https://wandb.ai/investai/portfolio-allocation}}, anyone can access the results of each run, including the stored models and datasets, and reproduce our findings while comparing them with their own experiments.


    \section{Weights \& Biases}\label{sec:wandb}
    Weights \& Biases (W\&B) is a powerful machine learning experiment tracking and visualization tool that helps data scientists and machine learning practitioners manage their experiments. With W\&B, users can log experiment metrics in real-time, track hyperparameters, and compare and reproduce experiments easily. W\&B offers various visualization tools like interactive plots, histograms, and confusion matrices, which help users analyze and understand experiment results.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Experiment tracking: W\&B allows users to log experiment metrics such as loss, accuracy, and other custom metrics in real-time during training. These metrics are logged to a central dashboard, making it easy to monitor and compare multiple experiments.
        \item Hyperparameter tuning: W\&B supports hyperparameter sweeps, allowing users to explore different hyperparameter configurations in parallel and find optimal hyperparameter settings for their models.
        \item Visualization: W\&B provides a variety of visualization tools, including interactive graphs, histograms, confusion matrices, and more, to help users analyze and understand experimental results. We use some of the W\&B graphs to compare hyperparameters and their values to understand their effect on the overall range of rewards~\crefrange{fig:wb-chart1}{fig:wb-chart3}.
        \item Artifact management: W\&B allows users to log and version datasets, models, and other artifacts, making it easy to track and reproduce experiments with specific data and model versions.
        \item Collaboration: W\&B enables team collaboration by allowing users to share experiment results, visualizations, and artifacts with team members, facilitating communication and collaboration among team members.
    \end{itemize}

    Since the W\&B API offers a number of features, we decided to focus on experiments and not describe them all. However, we recommend to consult the W\&B documentation available at \url{https://docs.wandb.ai/} for an explanation of all APIs and features, and to see the results of our experiments with all artifacts at \url{https://wandb.ai/investai/portfolio-allocation}.


    \section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
    All experiments are focused on several metrics. The first is whether the model can outperform standard indices such as the S\&P 500 Index, DJI Index and others. Second, what dataset is more appropriate for training the model. Finally, assessing the robustness of the model. All experiments will be documented during our testing period, which spans from \emph{2017-01-25} to \emph{2022-12-16}. As the datasets are derived from \emph{companies in the DJI Index}, we will primarily compare the performance of our models with the DJI Index to maintain consistency in the results. However, we will also make comparisons with other indices.

    \subsection{Baselines and Backtesting}\label{subsec:baselines-and-backtesting}
    In this subsection, we compare the performance of the agent to several baselines, including well-known market indexes and investment strategies. The following strategies and indexes were used as baselines:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The S\&P 500 Index (GSPC)} is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of 500 large publicly traded companies in the US. The index is maintained by S\&P Dow Jones Indices and is one of the most widely followed equity indices.
        \item \textbf{The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)} is a price-weighted index that tracks the stock performance of 30 large companies listed on US stock exchanges. It is also one of the most commonly followed equity indices.
        \item \textbf{The Russell 2000 (RUT)} is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 2,000 small-cap companies in the US. It is a subset of the Russell 3000 index, which represents about 98\% of the total market capitalization of the US equity market.
        \item \textbf{The NASDAQ Composite (IXIC)} is a stock market index that tracks the performance of all the companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, which is primarily composed of technology and growth-oriented companies. It is one of the most widely-followed stock market indices in the world.
        \item \textbf{Minimum Variance} is a portfolio allocation strategy that aims to minimize the variance of the portfolio's returns. The strategy assumes that the variance of the portfolio's returns is a measure of risk~\cite{investopedia}.
        \item \textbf{Maximum Sharpe Ratio} is a portfolio allocation strategy that aims to maximize the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio. The strategy assumes that the Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return~\cite{investopedia}.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Cumulative Returns}
    In \cref{fig:cumulative_return}, we demonstrate that an agent can achieve successful outcomes when trained with appropriate hyperparameters and dataset (model id: \emph{zfjr0ks0}), while unsuitable hyperparameters and dataset can result in unsatisfactory outcomes (model id: \emph{p3irnh80}). The \emph{zfjr0ks0} model surpassed standard indexes such as DJI, GSPC, IXIC, and RUT, although not consistently throughout the testing period. It is evident that the \emph{zfjr0ks0} model outperformed almost all baseline indexes and strategies, with the exception of \emph{IXIC} (Nasdaq 100 Index) during a specific period from 2020 until the end of the testing period in 2022, when our model began to outperform even \emph{IXIC}. This is a simple comparison between the model with the best and worst performance. Later, we will also compare our model with the one from \emph{AI4Finance}, but we currently lack the data to perform a full comparison over our entire testing period.
    \begin{figure}[h!]

        \caption{Cumulative returns of the best(zfjr0ks0) and worst(p3irnh80) performing models, indexes (DJI, GSPC, IXIC, RUT), and strategies (minimum variance and maximum Sharpe ratio), during the testing period (2017-2022).}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Drawdowns}
    Now we look how our models performing in drawdowns\footnote{In the stock market, drawdown refers to the percentage decline in an investment's value from its peak to its subsequent low point. Essentially, it represents the loss experienced by an investor in a particular investment over a certain period of time.} Based on the drawdown graphs in~\cref{fig:drawdown}, we observe that the best model, trained on appropriate datasets and hyperparameters, outperforms the DJI index for larger drawdowns (around $6\%$). Since our dataset comprises companies included in the DJI index we decide for our analysis compare the drawdowns of the model with the \emph{highest and lowest test/total\_reward}, as well as \emph{two indexes} (\emph{IXIC} and \emph{DJI}). The \emph{IXIC} (Nasdaq 100 Index) has been chosen as baseline for performance in drawdown, since it outperformed our model during the period between 2020 and 2022.

    \subsubsection{Monthly and Annual Returns}
    In~\cref{fig:month_annual_returns}, we compared our models against baseline indexes and strategies based on their \emph{monthly} and \emph{annual} returns. We presented the results in a graph, where the model with the highest return was compared to the \emph{DJI} and \emph{IXIC} indexes. Our model consistently outperformed the DJI index in most months and years, but was outperformed by the IXIC index in 2019, 2020, and 2021. However, in 2022, when the IXIC index lost over $-30\%$ of its value, our model was able to keep the majority of its value and only lost around $-8\%$.

    It's worth noting that our models achieved significant outperformance during the big drawdown period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The model with the highest return performed better than the DJI index during February, March, and April of 2020, indicating that our model was able to learn which companies with specific features were better to hold during this period.

    Although there were some months where the DJI index performed better than our models, the performance difference was not significant. Overall, we concluded that our models performed well in the majority of months, as demonstrated by the \emph{annual graphs}.

    It's important to note that our model was trained on companies from the DJI index, which may have influenced the comparison with the IXIC index. Therefore, the comparison may not be entirely fair. Nonetheless, the results suggest that our model is able to learn the better companies to hold during certain time periods and can outperform baseline indexes.

    \subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}\label{subsec:hyperparameters_tuning}
    Since the configuration of hyperparameters is crucial for the performance of a any machine learning model. We performed a hyperparameter sweep to find the best hyperparameters for our models through bunch of parameters showed in~\cref{tab:hyperparameters}. In this case, the hyperparameter sweep was performed on 27 hyperparameters using the Weights \& Biases Sweep, this helps us to track and visualize the training process and store bunch of hyperparameter configurations. The range or value of each hyperparameter was chosen based on prior knowledge.

    \subsubsection{Time Steps}\label{subsubsec:time_steps}
    We kept only one hyperparameter constant, which is the \emph{Time Steps} parameter. We conducted experiments by varying its value from $20000$ to $100000$ and found that values up to 50,000 were still improve the model's performance. However, values above $50000$ did not provide any significant improvement in the model's performance, and the training time increased considerably. As a result, we decided to use \textbf{50000 time steps} for all the models that we experimented with in this chapter. In the next subsubsection, we will discuss another hyperparameters and explain how we selected the range of values for them.

    \subsubsection{Selection of hyperparameters}\label{subsubsec:selection_of_hyperparameters}
    Once the range or values of each hyperparameter was set, the process of finding the best configuration of hyperparameters was a kind of brute force, except that we at least restrict the exploration space in which the W\&B Sweep is trying to find optimal hyperparameter through randomly selecting each hyperparameter for the given run.

    The Sweep involved 5 distinct reinforcement learning algorithms - namely A2C, PPO, SAC, DDPG, and TD3 - and each of these algorithms was trained on 3 unique datasets, which were introduced in the preceding chapter and referred to as Fundamental, Technical, and Combined. In total, this resulted in 15 different combinations of algorithms and datasets. Furthermore, each combination was subjected to 10 rounds of training, culminating in a total of 150 train/test runs. These runs are readily accessible on W\&B at the following URL: \url{https://wandb.ai/investai/portfolio-allocation}.

    It is worth emphasizing that when performing a hyperparameter sweep, certain hyperparameters may be selected even though the algorithm does not require them. In such cases, we simply discard those hyperparameters and only include the necessary ones in the algorithm.

    In~\cref{tab:hyperparameters}, the hyperparameters that underwent tuning during the hyperparameter sweep are displayed. The values enclosed in <> indicate the range from which W\&B Sweep can randomly select a value for a particular run, while those enclosed in [] represent the list of values from which W\&B Sweep can randomly choose a value for a particular run. The performance of the agent with respect to the hyperparameters is presented in the graphs, which compare and analyze the performance of several of the best and worst models. These graphs can be found in~\crefrange{fig:wb-chart1}{fig:wb-chart3}.

    \subsubsection{Hyperparameter Sweep Results}\label{subsubsec:hyperparameter_sweep_results}
    We evaluate the performance based on \emph{test/total\_reward} attribute. It distinguishes individual training runs, and the color of the curve corresponds to its value, a higher value of \emph{test/total\_reward} is represented by an \textcolor[RGB]{255,128,0}{orange curve, indicating better performance}, conversely, a lower value is represented by a \textcolor[RGB]{100,0,200}{purple curve, indicating poor performance}, in graphs~\crefrange{fig:wb-chart1}{fig:wb-chart3}. These graphs have two columns: the first column represents the \emph{algorithm}, and the last column represents the \emph{test/total\_reward}. The hyperparameters, which were tuned during the hyperparameter sweep, are located between these two columns. Including three graphs instead of one makes the results more readable and easier to analyze.

    The table~\cref{tab:best-worst-hyperparameters} presents the configurations of the top 2 and bottom 2 models, including their hyperparameters and the corresponding \emph{test/total\_reward} values. In the subsequent section, namely~\cref{subsec:robustness-testings}, we will examine whether this setup is robust or not by conducting multiple tests on the models and training them with the same hyperparameters.

    \subsubsection{How we calculate agent performance}\label{subsubsec:how_we_calculate_agent_performance}
    As previously mentioned, the agent's performance is assessed using the \emph{test/total\_reward} attribute. To compute the value of \emph{test/total\_reward}, we initialize its value to 1 at time $t=0$ and calculate it as the cumulative product of the rewards obtained by the agent during the testing phase, as shown in Equation~\cref{eq:portfolio-value}.

    For example, if the agent receives a reward of $-0.1$, which implies that the portfolio is worth $0.9$ or $90\%$ of its previous value, the value of \emph{test/total\_reward} would be $(CurrentReturn+1)\times CurrentPortfolioValue = (-0.1+1)\times 1 = 0.9$ in the second step. If in the second step the agent receives a reward of $0.1$, the value of \emph{test/total\_reward} would be $(0.1+1) \times 0.9 = 0.99$ in the third step, and so on. Therefore, if the final value of \emph{test/total\_reward} is $1.9$, it indicates that the agent obtained a total reward of $0.9$ throughout all the steps, which is equivalent to a portfolio return of $90\%$ over the testing period.

    \subsection{Datasets}\label{subsec:datasets}
    In the previous sections, we compared our models based on \emph{baseline} vs. \emph{portfolio return} and optimal \emph{hyperparameter configurations} for training the agent. Now, we will compare the performance of the models based on the \emph{datasets} used. We will compare the same models that were evaluated in the previous section, including the \emph{2 best} and \emph{2 worst} models, as well as several \emph{best and worst} models from the datasets of \emph{Fundamental Analysis}, \emph{Technical Analysis}, and \emph{Combined Analysis}. The results of this comparison are shown in Table~\cref{tab:best-worst-datasets}.

    Here we present 3 tables comparing the agent performance based on datasets. Although the results in Table~\cref{tab:best-worst-datasets} may vary depending on the hyperparameters, we can still observe that the \emph{Technical Dataset} is the worst, while the \emph{Combined Dataset} is the best, and the \emph{Fundamental Dataset} is good enough for training the agent.

    Our assumption that the \emph{Fundamental Dataset} would be sufficient for training a profitable agent has been confirmed, although the \emph{Combined Dataset} can yield better results despite being more complex and difficult to train. As expected, the \emph{Technical Dataset} performed the worst, as technical indicators are not as reliable as fundamental indicators for assessing the health and future growth of a company.

    \subsection{Against the Other Publicly Available RL Agents}\label{subsec:against-the-other-publicly-available-rl-agents}


    \section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
    In this chapter, we conducted empirical experiments to evaluate how well a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent can perform in the portfolio management task. Our results show that DRL has a huge potential in portfolio allocation as it can outperform common strategies and indexes. We used DRL algorithms to explore the relationship between the reward (i.e., portfolio return) and the input (i.e., features) and measured the prediction power using portfolio metrics. We found that the Fundamental Features or a combination of Fundamental and Technical Analysis features can effectively describe the environment and be used to train DRL agents.

    Portfolio management is a challenging task that requires a lot of data, which is often expensive and difficult to obtain. Our Stock Portfolio Allocation Environment, modeled using MDP, aims to identify how stocks are valued and which State Space features affect price movements. We assume that the Financial Market operates like any other market where the price of a stock or asset increases when people buy it and decreases when people sell it. Therefore, our model attempts to predict how much each feature affects future price movements (people's interest to buy/sell). Since the Stock Market is predominantly controlled by "Big Money" players such as banks and hedge funds, we believe that our research is crucial for portfolio managers to improve their decision-making capabilities.

    In addition to the future work mentioned earlier, we see a great opportunity to extend our model by incorporating a system that automatically places orders to the broker based on the weight predicted by our model. This would streamline the entire process of portfolio management and eliminate the need for manual intervention.

    Furthermore, we believe that our model can benefit from the inclusion of additional features such as sentiment analysis, macroeconomic factors, and industry-specific factors. The inclusion of these features can help our model to better capture the market's behavior and improve its performance.

    Another area of improvement that we believe warrants further exploration is the reward function. While our experiments have shown that the reward function we used was effective to some extent, we acknowledge that it may not capture all the nuances of the market. Therefore, we recommend exploring alternative reward functions that can better account for the goodness or badness of actions taken by the agent.

    Overall, we believe that our study has demonstrated the potential of DRL in portfolio allocation, but there are still many avenues for improvement and further research. By incorporating these future works, we can enhance the performance of our model and make it more suitable for real-world applications.
